  Terraform module which creates [EC2 security group within VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) on AWS.
  These types of resources are supported:
  * [EC2-VPC Security Group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/security_group.html)
  * [EC2-VPC Security Group Rule](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/security_group_rule.html)

  ## Features

  This module aims to implement **ALL** combinations of arguments supported by AWS and latest stable version of Terraform:
  * IPv4/IPv6 CIDR blocks
  * [VPC endpoint prefix lists](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints.html) (use data source [aws_prefix_list](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/prefix_list.html))
  * Access from source security groups
  * Access from self
  * Named rules ([see the rules here](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/blob/master/rules.tf))
  * Named groups of rules with ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) ports open for common scenarios (eg, [ssh](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/modules/ssh), [http-80](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/modules/http-80), [mysql](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/modules/mysql), see the whole list [here](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/blob/master/modules/README.md))
  * Conditionally create security group and all required security group rules ("single boolean switch").
